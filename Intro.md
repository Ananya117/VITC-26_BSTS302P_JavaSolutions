# VITC-26_BSTS302P_JavaSolutions
💻 Easy implementations of all BSTS302P questions. 

📌 About  
- No fancy data structures—just good old arrays.  
- The goal? Pass the test cases, nothing more.  
- Optimized solutions has left the chat.  

⚠️ Disclaimer:  
- If it works, it works.  
- If it doesn’t… well, it should.  
- May contain zero elegance, but hey, test cases don’t care.  

NOTE: I fully understand the importance of data structures and I can assure you that I can still solve these using pointers and what not. But let’s be real — last-minute, caffeine-fueled study sessions just to pass the course aren’t exactly motivating. So, here we are. 🚀☕
